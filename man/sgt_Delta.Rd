\title{Smooth Good-Toulmin estimate of \eqn{\Delta(t)}, the (expected)
number of new variants in
a future (test) cohort that is \eqn{t} times as large as the
training cohort}
\usage{
sgt_Delta(counts = NULL, r = NULL, N_r = NULL, m, t = 1, adj = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{vector of counts or frequencies of the observed variants.}

\item{r}{unique frequencies.}

\item{N_r}{frequency of frequency r.}

\item{m}{training cohort size.}

\item{t}{positive scalar. The proportion of the future (test) cohort size to the
training cohort size.}

\item{adj}{logical. Should the Orlitsky et al. adjustment be used?
Defaults to \code{TRUE}. Ignored if \code{t < 1}.}

\description{
Smooth Good-Toulmin estimate of \eqn{\Delta(t)}, the (expected)
number of new variants in
a future (test) cohort that is \eqn{t} times as large as the
training cohort
}
\details{
Computes the original Good Toulmin (1956) estimate of \eqn{\Delta(t)} if \code{t <= 1}. If
\code{t > 1}, the Efron-Thisted estimate (if \code{adj = FALSE}) or the
Efron-Thisted estimate with Orlitsky et al. (2016) adjustment (if \code{adj = TRUE}) is computed. Also
returns an approximate standard error ("se") of the estimate as an attribute, computed using the formula
provided in Efron-Thisted (1976, equation 5.2).
}
\note{
Either (a) \code{counts}, or (b) \code{r} and
\code{N_r} must be provided.
